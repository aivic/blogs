## Introduction
In this guide, you are going to learn about the fundamentals of controlling the Seaborn figure. It is well known that Matplotlib provides an extensive list of modules, methods and attributes to make a figure more appealing but still lacks on high-level methods. On the other hand, Seaborn provides frequently used high-level methods built upon Matplotlib.

By the end of this guide you will be able to implement the following concepts:


1. Handling Seaborn figure styles
2. Removing axes spines
3. Overriding elements of the Seaborn styles
4. Scaling plot elements

## The Baseline
In this guide we are going to use the following libraries:

**Syntax**


```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Handling Seaborn Figure Styles
The impact of colors in a plot plays an important role like highlighting an insight or diminishing it. Consider a plot created from the given code:


```python
# Setting a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=1)

# Setting background color to blue
ax.set_facecolor('b')

# Creating a line plot
plt.plot([1, 5, 8, 9, 2], linewidth=3)

# Displaying the result
plt.show()
```

As you can observe that creating a light blue line over a dark blue background can diminish the effect of the line plot. The effect even goes worse if we choose any other wrong combination with more details on plot (more lines). Therefore, choosing a right figure style is utmost necessary.

By default, Seaborn provides five figure styles to highlight the important aspect in a plot. Given below are the five figure styles:

1. darkgrid 
2. whitegrid 
3. dark 
4. white 
5. ticks

Initial two styles (darkgrid and whitegrid) can be useful in a situation when there's any quantitative variable is involved. Dark and white can be used to focus on the chart details rather than the grids. The last, ticks can be used to improvise the structure of the plot.

Let us implement them with an example.

### 1. Darkgrid and Whitegrid
To understand the relevance of `darkgrid` and `whitegrid`, we will use some quantitative data.

First, let we build a box plot using random data and showcase implementation of `darkgrid`. The insights from the plot is heavily dependent upon how well the grid is presented.


```python
# Setting figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
x = np.array([85, 44, 5, 2, 6, 77, 5, 24, 1, 2, 9, 5, 7, 11, 2, 5, 7, 99, 56, 22, 25])
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x})

# Setting darkgrid figure style
sns.set_style('darkgrid')

# Plotting
sns.boxplot(x='x', data=df, color='g', orient='v')

# Labeling
plt.title('Darkgrid Figure Style', weight='bold', fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel('x', fontsize=14)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

As you can observe from the figure that grid lines play an important role to have an estimate of each quartile. You can also use `whitegrid` in place of `darkgrid` in the above code.

Second, let us build a barplot and observe how `whitegrid` helps to estimate the height of each bar as shown:


```python
# Setting figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
x = np.array(['A', 'B', 'C'])
y = np.array([85, 44, 25])
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})

# Setting whitegrid figure style
sns.set_style('whitegrid')

# Plotting
sns.barplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)

# Labeling
plt.title('Whitegrid Figure Style', weight='bold', fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel('x', fontsize=14)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

### 2. Dark and White
Let us consider a function `f(x)` and its given value `x`. We need to plot `f(x)` against `x` and emphasize on the function lines rather than the background. 


```python
# Setting figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
x = np.arange(100)
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x,
                  'Fx': np.sin(2*np.pi*x)})

# Setting dark figure style
sns.set_style('dark')

# Plotting
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='Fx', data=df, color='g')

# Labeling
plt.title('Dark Figure Style', weight='bold', fontsize=18)
plt.xlabel('x', fontsize=14)
plt.ylabel('Fx', fontsize=14)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

As we can observe that function curve lines can be easily separated out from the background. 
In a similar way, we can built a `white` figure style plot. In the above code, instead of `sns.set_style('dark')`, write `sns.set_style('white')`. The output is shown below:

### 3. Ticks
Ticks provide an additional structure to a plot. Therefore, it depends on the user where one needs to deploy them. Here's a small example with the implementation of `ticks` figure style.


```python
# Initializing the data
x = np.array([9, 50, 2])
y = np.array([85, 44, 25])
z = np.array([32, 65, 12])
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z})

# Setting ticks figure style
sns.set_style('ticks')

# Plotting
sns.pairplot(df)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

**Taking control of figure style temporarily**
Many a times, it is required that you don't interfare with the original settings of the program, and therefore, in such scenario the keyword `with` helps to bring changes temporarily.

Using the `with` keyword, you can change the figure style only for one plot at a time without hindering the settings of the overall program. Let us understand this using an example where we initially set `darkgrid`, but try to create a plot with `whitegrid` using the `with` keyword, followed by another plot (which will have no effect from the `whitegrid`).


```python
# Setting the first figure size
plt.figure(0, figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
x = np.array([9, 50, 2])
y = np.array([85, 44, 25])
z = np.array([32, 65, 12])
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z})

# Setting darkgrid figure style for complete program
sns.set_style('darkgrid')

# Plotting with whitegrid figure style
with sns.axes_style('whitegrid'):
    sns.barplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)

# Setting the second figure size
plt.figure(1, figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting with base figure style (darkgrid) 
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

![Second](https://i.imgur.com/xIpDOm6.png)

As you can observe that first figure style has not been effected by the global figure style. Notice, we have to use `axes_style` along with the `with` keyword, the `set_style` keyword will result in an `AttributeError`.

## Removing Axes Splines
In many publications, you may have came across to figures with partial axes i.e., one or two axis removed out of all four. Such task can be achieved in Seaborn using a method, `despline`. By default, it removes top and right axis, however, it also provides flexibility to remove or retain all four axes as shown below:


```python
# Setting the first figure size
plt.figure(0, figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
x = np.arange(200)
y = np.sin(2 * np.pi * x)
df = pd.DataFrame({'x': x, 'y': y})

# Setting ticks figure style
sns.set_style('ticks')

# Plotting
sns.lineplot(x='x', y='y', data=df)

# Removing right and top axes
sns.despine()

# Labelling
plt.title('Figure without top and right axes', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

If you want to remove left and bottom axes too, then pass `sns.despine(left=True, bottom=True)`.
