## Introduction
The objective of this guide covers the path effect creation using shadows and outlines along with the necessary transformations to handle figure and axes coordinate systems.

After completing this guide, you will be able to do the followings: 
1. Standing out your visualizations using several path effects. 
2. Getting more control of your visualizations by controlling data, axes, figure and display coordinates.

## The Baseline
Importing the necessary library to be used in the guide:

**Syntax:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patheffects as path_effects
```

## Implementation of Path Effects
The path effects provide a succinct way to define paths that objects follow on a canvas. Such effects can be applied on `Path` artists including `Patch`, `Line2D`, `Collection` and even `Text`.

The effects are achievable using the `patheffects` module from the Matplotlib package and controlled via the `set_path_effects` method.

Let us discuss the three most commonly used path effects:
1. Normal
2. Drop-shadow
3. Outline

### 1. Normal Path Effect
This path effect brings no changes to the artist. In the given figure, we pass the normal path effect to the plot and as can be observed no new changes have been observed.


```python
# Initializing x and y coordinates
x = [1, 1, 3, 5, 5]
y = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]

# Defining the path effect
pe = [path_effects.Normal()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting
plt.plot(x, y, path_effects=pe, linewidth=8, color='Orange')

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

### 2. Drop-Shadow Path Effect
The next effect, the drop-shadow effect applies to all artists and draws either a filled patch or a line patch below the original artist. It uses two classes to perform the changes which are:
* SimplePatchShadow
* SimpleLineShadow

Let us learn to implement these classes in the following figure: 


```python
# Initializing x and y coordinates
x = [1, 1, 3, 5, 5]
y = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]

# Defining the path effects
pe1 = [path_effects.SimplePatchShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]
pe2 = [path_effects.SimpleLineShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]

# To avoid writing path_effects.Normal() after the SimplePatchShadow() class, 
# you can also use 'with' as shown:
# pe1 = [path_effects.withSimplePatchShadow()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Using SimplePatchShadow
plt.text(2.2, 4, 'Hello, world!', path_effects=pe1, fontsize=25, color='Green')

# Using SimpleLineShadow
plt.plot(x, y, path_effects=pe2, linewidth=8, color='Orange')

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

### 3. Outline Path Effect
This effect helps to draw an outline around the text to make it stand out. This is achieved using the `Stroke` class as shown:


```python
# Defining the path effect
pe = [path_effects.SimplePatchShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting text
statement = plt.text(0.2, 0.5, 'Hello, world!', fontsize=50, color='Green')

statement.set_path_effects([path_effects.Stroke(linewidth=3, foreground='Orange'), path_effects.Normal()])

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```
