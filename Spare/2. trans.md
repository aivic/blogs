## Introduction
In the previous [guide](), you were introduced to the SciPy module, got familiarized with its organization and learned few basic methods. In this guide, you will learn about how SciPy extends the functionality of NumPy to provide rich linear algebra methods for developers and mathematicians. 

By the end of this guide you'll be able to learn the following topics:


1. Difference between NumPy and SciPy linear algebra module
2. Linear Algebra basic routines
3. Decompositions 
4. Matrix Functions 
5. Special Matrices

## The Baseline
Throughout this guide, we will be using the following libraries:


```python
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
from scipy import linalg
```

## Difference Between the NumPy and the SciPy Linear Algebra Module
The table below highlights the difference between both the modules:

| SciPy's linalg module | NumPy's linalg module |
| --- | --- |
| It has all the methods which are available in NumPy's linalg module, including some extra methods. | All the methods here also lies in the SciPy's linalg module.|
| It is always compiled using the BLAS/LAPACK support. | It is optional for this module to compile using the BLAS/LAPACK support. |

## Linear Algebra Basic Routines

All the inputs and outputs to a SciPy linalg module is a two-dimensional matrix. Therefore, before we understand some basic routines of the linear algebra module, let us first clear the differentiation between `np.matrix` and matrix formed using `np.ndarray`.

The `np.matrix` is a quite convenient method to constuct a two-dimensional matrix. On the top of that, it also supports attributes like `I` and `T` for inverse and transpose respectively.


```python
# Construction of a 2D matrix using np.matrix
mat = np.matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
mat

# Output:
# matrix([[1, 2],
#         [3, 4]])

# Matrix inverse using I attribute
mat.I

# Output:
# matrix([[-2. ,  1. ],
#         [ 1.5, -0.5]])

# Matrix transpose using T attribute
mat.T

# Output:
# matrix([[1, 3],
#         [2, 4]])

# Dot product
mat * mat

# Output:
# array([[ 7, 10],
#        [15, 22]])
```

Being quite convenient, the use of `np.matrix` method is still discouraged because whatever we can achieve using this method, we can also do it using the `np.array` method, may be with some dependencies as shown:


```python
# Construction of a 2D matrix using np.array
mat = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]]).reshape(2, 2)
mat

# Output:
# matrix([[1, 2],
#         [3, 4]])

# Matrix inverse using inv method
np.linalg.inv(mat)

# linalg.inv(mat) # Same answer using SciPy linalg

# Output:
# array([[-2. ,  1. ],
#        [ 1.5, -0.5]])

# Matrix transpose using the T attribute
mat.T

# Output:
# array([[1, 3],
#        [2, 4]])

# Dot product
np.dot(mat, mat)

# Output:
# array([[ 7, 10],
#        [15, 22]])
```

Now, that we have understood the pros and cons of each method, we can advance to basic routines of linear algebra:


1. Finding inverse
2. Solving equations
3. Finding determinants
4. Computing norms

We assume that you have knowledge about these terms and are skipping the introduction to these basic terms. Therefore, let us take an example for each and implement them using the linalg module of the SciPy.


```python
# Construction of a 3x3 matrix using np.array
mat = np.array([5, 4, 1, 2, 8, 6, 3, 7, 1]).reshape(3, 3)
mat

# array([[5, 4, 1],
#        [2, 8, 6],
#        [3, 7, 1]])

# ====================================
# 1. Finding the inverse of the matrix
# ====================================

linalg.inv(mat)

# Output:
# array([[ 0.29310345, -0.02586207, -0.13793103],
#        [-0.13793103, -0.01724138,  0.24137931],
#        [ 0.0862069 ,  0.19827586, -0.27586207]])

# ====================================
# 2. Finding determinant of the matrix
# ====================================

linalg.det(mat)

# Output:
# -116.0

# ================================
# 3. Computing norm of the matrix
# ================================

linalg.norm(mat) # Frobenius norm
# 14.317821063276353

linalg.norm(mat, 1) # L1 norm
# 19.0

linalg.norm(mat, -1) # Min column sum
# 8.0

linalg.norm(mat, np.inf) # L inf norm
# 16.0


# ===================================
# 4. Solving system of linear equations
# ===================================

A = np.array([[1, 3, 5], [2, 5, 1], [2, 3, 8]])
b = np.array([[10], [8], [3]])

linalg.solve(A, b)

# Solution:
# array([[-9.28],
#        [ 5.16],
#        [ 0.76]])
```
