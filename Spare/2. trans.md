## Introduction
In this guide you will learn about various image processing and analysis methods provided by SciPy. So far we have introduced you with SciPy's Linear Algebra, Stats and Optimize subpackages. In this guide, we are going to focus on another SciPy subpackage named `ndimage`.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to implement the following concepts using SciPy:


1. Filter functions 
2. Interpolation functions 
3. Morphology 
4. Segmentation


## The Baseline
Throughout this guide, we will be using the following libraries:


```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
from scipy import ndimage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Filter Functions
In this section, let us discuss the implementation of given filter categories:


1. Smoothing filters
2. Filters based on order statistics
3. Derivatives
4. Generic filter function

### 1. Smoothing Filters
SciPy provides four smoothing filter methods namely:


**a. gaussian_filter1d:** It implements a one-dimensional Gaussian filter. Here, the parameter `sigma` controls the standard-deviation of the Gaussian filter. An `order` of 0 would perform convolution with a Gaussian kernel, whereas, an `order` of 1, 2 or 3 would convolve with first, second and third derivatives of a Gaussian.
**b. gaussian_filter:** This method implements a multidimensional Gaussian filter. Here, parameter sigma accepts a sequence of standard-deviation along each axis. In case if a sequence is not passed rather a single number then the standard-deviation is assumed equal in all directions.
**c. uniform_filter1d:** This method calculates a one-dimensional uniform filter of the given `size` along the given axis.
**d. uniform_filter:** This method implements a multidimensional filter. This method also follows a similar concept as `gaussian_filter` method where the size of uniform filter are given for each axis in the form of a sequence of numbers via the `size` parameter. However, if no sequence is passed, but a single number, then the sizes along all the axis are considered equal.

Here, we show the implementation of these filters:


```python

```
