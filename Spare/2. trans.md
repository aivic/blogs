## Introduction
The objective of this guide covers the path effect creation using shadows and outlines along with the necessary transformations to handle figure and axes coordinate systems.

After completing this guide, you will be able to do the followings: 
1. Standing out your visualizations using several path effects. 
2. Getting more control of your visualizations by controlling data, axes, figure and display coordinates.


## The Baseline
Importing the necessary library to be used in the guide:

**Syntax:**

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.patheffects as path_effects
import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
```

## Implementation of Path Effects
The path effects provide a succinct way to define paths that objects follow on a canvas. Such effects can be applied on `Path` artists including `Patch`, `Line2D`, `Collection` and even `Text`.

The effects are achievable using the `patheffects` module from the Matplotlib package and controlled via the `set_path_effects` method.

Let us discuss the three most commonly used path effects:
1. Normal
2. Drop-shadow
3. Outline

### 1. Normal Path Effect
This path effect brings no changes to the artist. In the given figure, we pass the normal path effect to the plot and as can be observed no new changes have been observed.


```python
# Initializing x and y coordinates
x = [1, 1, 3, 5, 5]
y = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]

# Defining the path effect
pe = [path_effects.Normal()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting
plt.plot(x, y, path_effects=pe, linewidth=8, color='Orange')

# Labelling the title
plt.title('Normal Path Effect', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

### 2. Drop-Shadow Path Effect
The next effect, the drop-shadow effect applies to all artists and draws either a filled patch or a line patch below the original artist. It uses two classes to perform the changes which are:
* SimplePatchShadow
* SimpleLineShadow

Let us learn to implement these classes in the following figure: 


```python
# Initializing x and y coordinates
x = [1, 1, 3, 5, 5]
y = [1, 5, 1, 5, 1]

# Defining the path effects
pe1 = [path_effects.SimplePatchShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]
pe2 = [path_effects.SimpleLineShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]

# To avoid writing path_effects.Normal() after the SimplePatchShadow() class, 
# you can also use 'with' as shown:
# pe1 = [path_effects.withSimplePatchShadow()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Using SimplePatchShadow
plt.text(2.2, 4, 'Hello, world!', path_effects=pe1, fontsize=25, color='Green')

# Using SimpleLineShadow
plt.plot(x, y, path_effects=pe2, linewidth=8, color='Orange')

# Labelling title
plt.title('Drop-Shadow Path Effect', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

### 3. Outline Path Effect
This effect helps to draw an outline around the text to make it stand out. This is achieved using the `Stroke` class as shown:


```python
# Defining the path effect
pe = [path_effects.SimplePatchShadow(), path_effects.Normal()]

# Defining the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Plotting text
statement = plt.text(0.2, 0.5, 'Hello, world!', fontsize=50, color='Green')

statement.set_path_effects([path_effects.Stroke(linewidth=3, foreground='Orange'), path_effects.Normal()])

# Labelling title
plt.title('Outline Path Effect', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

## Handling Transformations

To take control of internal features available within Matplotlib, we can utilize various transformations like data, axes, figure, display, etc which helps in moving between the coordinate systems.  Following is the list of coordinate systems along with their objects (`ax` stands for Axis and `fig` stands for Figure) which we are going to discuss:

| **Coordinate system** | **Object** |
| --- | --- |
| data | ax.transData |
| axes | ax.transAxes |
| figure | fig.transFigure | 
| figure-inches | fig.dpi_scale_trans | 
| display | None or IdentityTransform() |
| xaxis,  yaxis | ax.get_xaxis_transform(), ax.get_yaxis_transform() |


All the transformations present in the above table converts their input to display coordinate system and that is the reason that display coordinate system has None object because it is already in the display coordinate system.

Let us briefly take a look at **data**, **axes** and **figure-inches** coordinate systems through an example.

### 1. Data Coordinate system

When the data is added to a plot, Matplotlib automatically updates the data limits. We can also change the data limits using `set_xlim()` and `set_ylim()` methods. Once the data limits are set then we can find the corresponding display coordinates using `ax.transData` object.

Let us take an example of a traingle, we set the data limits of x and y axis and look for the display coordinates on the data coordinates (3, 3).


```python
# Initializing x and y coordinates
x = [1, 3, 5, 1]
y = [1, 3, 1, 1]

# Plotting basic figure with manual x and y limits
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))
ax.plot(x, y, c='Orange', linewidth=5)
ax.set_xlim(0, 6)
ax.set_ylim(0, 4)

# Finding display coordinates
xdata, ydata = 3, 3
xdisplay, ydisplay = ax.transData.transform_point((xdata, ydata))

# Labelling data and display coordinates
plt.text(2, 3.1, 'Data Coordinate: (3, 3)\nDisplay coordinate: ('+ str(round(xdisplay)) + ',' + str(round(ydisplay)) + ')')

# Labelling title
plt.title('Data to Display Coordinate', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

![Data](https://i.imgur.com/cZ79XnG.png)

As you may observe that for the given figure the size provided is (8, 5). The display coordinate is dependent upon the size of a figure. If you change the figure size, the display coordinate changes too. To retrieve the results back from the display coordinate system to data coodinate system, we can use `inverted` as shown:


```python
# Fetching data coordinates from the display coordinates 
ax.transData.inverted().transform((xdisplay, ydisplay))

# Output
# array([3., 3.])
```

### 2. Axes Coordinate System
After the data coordinate system, next most helpful coordinate system is the axes coordinate system. With the help of this system we get a better control over placing text in the figure. The table given below lists few of such instances considering a figure with x-limit (0, 1) and y-limit (0, 1):

| **Coordinate** | **Location** |
| --- | --- |
| (0, 0) | Bottom Left |
| (1, 0) | Bottom Right |
| (1, 1) | Top Right |
| (0, 1) | Top Left |
| (0.5, 0.5) | Center |

Let us learn to label text in each of these five listed locations: 


```python
# Initializing the text coordinates and the text labels
x = [0, 0.75, 0.82, 0, 0.45]
y = [0.01, 0.01, 0.95, 0.95, 0.5]
labels = ['Bottom Left', 'Bottom Right', 'Top Right', 'Top Left', 'Center']

# Initializing the figure
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 5))

# Labelling the text
for i in range(5):
    ax.text(x[i], y[i], labels[i], transform=ax.transAxes, fontsize=16)

# Labelling title
plt.title('Axes Coordinate', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

### 3. Figure Coordinate System in Inches

While constructing a figure, most of the times we may need a particular piece of figure intact which doesn't change in its size and shape even if the figure size is modified. Figure coordinate system provides `fig.dpi_scale_trans` object to provide support under such circumstances.

Let us take a circle and plot it at the center of a figure with shape (5, 5) as shown:


```python
# Setting figure size to 5, 5
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5))

# Adding a circle in fixed-units
circ = mpatches.Circle((2.3, 2.3), 1.0, transform=fig.dpi_scale_trans,
                       facecolor='Orange')
ax.add_patch(circ)

# Labelling title
plt.title('Figure Coordinate', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```

![Figure_1](https://i.imgur.com/T0E7ABO.png)

Now, let us change the figure size to (5, 2) as shown:


```python
# Setting figure size to 5, 2
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 2))

# Adding a circle in fixed-units
circ = mpatches.Circle((2.3, 2.3), 1.0, transform=fig.dpi_scale_trans,
                       facecolor='Orange')
ax.add_patch(circ)

# Labelling title
plt.title('Figure shape: (5, 2)', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the results
plt.show()
```
![Figure_2](https://i.imgur.com/ZJdnQJW.png)

As you can observe the circle remains intact without any change to its original shape and location.
