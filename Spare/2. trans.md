## Introduction
In this guide you will learn about various image processing and analysis methods provided by SciPy. So far we have introduced you with SciPy's Linear Algebra, Stats and Optimize subpackages. In this guide, we are going to focus on another SciPy subpackage named `ndimage`.

By the end of this guide, you will be able to implement the following concepts using SciPy:


1. Filter functions 
2. Interpolation functions 
3. Morphology 
4. Segmentation


## The Baseline
Throughout this guide, we will be using the following libraries:


```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import scipy as sp
from scipy import ndimage
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Filter Functions
