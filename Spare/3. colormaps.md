## Introduction
In this guide, we are going to learn about creating a custom toggle button in React JS with step by step guide and the methodology involved in the same. After going through this guide, you will not only be in a position to create the image toggle button with ease, rather know about the tools by which you can change color, styling and other attributes. Let’s get started and know about creating a toggle button in React JS.

## How to Create a Toggle Button?
The role of buttons in almost every application is inevitable as they form an essential UI component. There are multiple uses of buttons as they are used for triggering API calls, navigation etc. Here, we are going to create a custom toggle button which is going to be unselected by default. As far as functionality is concerned, it results in the change of button’s style when it is tapped by the user, thereby making it look selected.

Let’s learn about detecting the tap event, add styles on the basis of component state, keeping the button’s state and using an image as an UI. 

## The Procedure
Here’s how you can create a new app taking in use of the React Native CLI. 

**How to start?**


As a first step, you need to create a source (say `src`) folder in order to store the main content. It is in this folder, creation of the `images` folder and the `MainApp.js` file will take place.

Secondly, for this class, now let’s import the dependencies:


```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { 
   StyleSheet, 
   View, 
    Image, 
    Text, 
    TouchableHighlight, 
    } from 'react-native'; 
 
const heartIcon = require('./images/test_image.png'); 
```

As a third step, it is required to keep the button’s `state` when it is pressed for our particular example. Hence, it is required creating a class that is extendible from `Component`. This is given as under:


```javascript
class MainApp extends Component { 
	state = { 
		liked: false, 
    }; 
        
	_onPressBtn = () => { 
	// We will define the content in step 6 
	} 
 
    render() { 
    // We will define the content in step 4 
    } 
} 

```

Moving to the fourth step, the content of the new component is required to be defined under the `render` method. It gets important here that the `Image` button is defined with a `Text` underneath.


```javascript
render() { 
	return ( 
		<View style = {styles.container} > 
        	<TouchableHighlight 
                style = {styles.btn} 
                underlayColor = "#fefefe" 
            > 
            <Image 
            	source = {heartIcon} 
            	style = {styles.icon} 
            /> 
            </ TouchableHighlight > 
              <Text style = {styles.text} > This is an example on image toggle button </ Text > 
            </ View > 
	); 
} 
```

In the fifth step, in order to set position, colors, margins and dimensions and for other purposes, its important to define few styles.


```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create( { 
	container: { 
    	marginTop: 50, 
        alignItems: 'center', 
	}, 
    btn: { 
    	borderRadius: 5, 
        padding: 10, 
	}, 
    icon: { 
    	width: 180, 
        height: 180, 
        tintColor: '#f1f1f1', 
	}, 
    liked: { 
    	tintColor: '#e74c3c', 
	}, 
    text: { 
    	marginTop: 20, 
	}, 
}); 
```

Moving to the sixth step, the `_onPressBtn` function content is required to be defined so as to respond to the tap event. Thereafter, to the `onPress` property, it is assigned as a callback.


```javascript
class MainApp extends Component { 
	state = { 
    	liked: false, 
	}; 
 
	_onPressBtn = () => { 
    	this.setState({ 
			liked: !this.state.liked, 
		}); 
         } 
 
	render() { 
    	return ( 
        	<View style = {styles.container} > 
               < TouchableHighlight 
                 	onPress = { this._onPressBtn } 
                 	style = {styles.btn} 
                 	underlayColor = "#fefefe" 
               > 
                 <Image source = {heartIcon} style = {styles.icon} /> 
               </ TouchableHighlight > 
               <Text style = {styles.text} > This is an example on image toggle button </ Text> 
             </ View> 
		); 
       } 
} 
```

Moving to the seventh step; in case we are going to test the code, we won’t find any change in the UI, although with the pressing of the button, the state on the component is getting changed. As a next procedure, try modifying the image with different color when there is a change in the state. By this way, the response from the UI can be witnessed with ease.


```javascript
render() { 
	const likedStyles = this.state.liked ? styles.liked : null; 
  
    return ( 
    	<View style = { styles.container } > 
             <TouchableHighlight 
               	onPress = { this._onPressBtn } 
               	style = { styles.btn } 
               	underlayColor = "#fefefe" 
             > 
             <Image 
                 source = { heartIcon } 
                 style = { [styles.icon, likedStyles] } 
               /> 
             </ TouchableHighlight > 
             <Text style = { styles.text } > This is an example on image toggle button </ Text > 
           </ View > 
	); 
} 
```

The work on this class is almost done. The only thing remaining is the export. The following line can be added at the end of file:


```javascript
export default MainApp; 
```

At last, `index.android.js` and `index.ios.js` are the files that are required to be updated. This will result in importing as well as using the new class.


```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react'; 
import { AppRegistry } from 'react-native'; 
import MainApp from './src/MainApp'; 
 
AppRegistry.registerComponent
('ButtonsAndEvents', () => MainApp); 
```

Let’s get on the next section related to the working methodology. Here, step by step guide is available to help you understand the basics and implement the things with ease. 


## Working Methodology
Well, now when it comes to the second step, more important tasks are required to be implemented. Yes, here `TouchableHighlight` component is required to be imported. It is considered very important as it is entrusted with the task of taking care of touch event which has a very important role to play. 

As soon as, the active area is touched by the user, the content gets highlighted on the basis of the preset `underlayerColor`.

Coming to the third most crucial step, here the `Component` state is defined. In our example, just one property is taken on the `state`, though it may vary as required. So feel free to change the quantity as per your liking.

Now, skipping few steps and coming to the sixth step, `setState` method is used in order to modify the liked property value. The inheritance of this method is from the extendible class of component.

In seventh step, on the basis of the liked property current state, styles are used in order to set the image color to red. In case, if it is required to avoid any sort of style, then a null is returned. In the process of assignment of the styles to the component of the image, the use of array is noteworthy as it results in assigning a number of objects. It is considered very feasible as the resultant is the merging of all styles into one object by the component internally. The highest index bearing objects are entrusted with the task of overwriting the properties in the array from the lowest object.

## What else can you do?
When it comes to the real application, a number of buttons are taken into use with different attributes. For instance, you can use buttons with an icon that is simply aligned to the left hand side, colors, labels, and different sizes etc. Thus there are a number of possibilities. We highly recommend making use of a reusable component so as to get rid of the problem of duplicating the code. 
In the advanced version, you may get to know the implementation of the dynamic user interfaces. Under this, you will learn about creating a button component that is good enough to handle few situations as discussed above.

## Conclusion 
In this guide, you have learned the step by step procedure to create a custom image toggle button in ReactJS.
