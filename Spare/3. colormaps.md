## Introduction
This guide is the third part of the series _Integrating Bootstrap with React_. To learn about the basic integration of Bootstrap with React, you can refer the first guide, [Integrating Bootstrap with React - Part 1]() and to learn about third-party library for their integration you can refer to [Integrating Bootstrap with React - Part 2]().

In this successive guide, you will learn about few of the Bootstrap style components available in React.

## Bootstrap Style Components in React

As now Reactstrap is on tips, there are numerous components of Bootstrap that can be used along with the React. We shall be taking them in separate guide, but here you will get to know few essential components and their application in the project. For instance, an app of contact list!

### 1. Navigation Bar

If you are looking for components of navigation bar that are responsive, then you may count on Reactstrap Navigation Bars. Sub-Components are also possible in a Navbar like Navltem, NavbarBrand, and Nav etc. for the sake of making the organization of navigation links in a proper manner.

A `<Navbar Toggler>` can be included inside the component of `<Navbar>`, so as to see the NavBar is responsive. Thereafter, you can may wrap the `<Navklterms>` in the component of `<Collapse>`.

Given below code depicts how React State and the component of Navbar can be used for the storage of toggle data.


```javascript
export default class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);

    this.toggle = this.toggle.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      isOpen: false
    };
  }
  toggle() {
    this.setState({
      isOpen: !this.state.isOpen
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <Navbar color = "faded" light expand = "md">
            {/* Brandname */}
               <NavbarBrand href = "/">
                Demo
            </NavbarBrand>
               {/* Add toggler to auto-collapse */}
          <NavbarToggler onClick = {this.toggle} />
          <Collapse isOpen = {this.state.isOpen} navbar>

              {/*Pull left */}
            <Nav className = "ml-auto" navbar>
                <NavItem>
                    <NavLink href = "/link/">
                        Left Nav Link
                    </NavLink>
                </NavItem>
            </Nav>

            {/* Pull right */}
            <Nav className = "mr-auto" navbar>
              <UncontrolledDropdown nav inNavbar>
                <DropdownToggle nav caret>
                  Bob
                </DropdownToggle>

                <DropdownMenu >
                  <DropdownItem>
                    Account
                  </DropdownItem>
                  <DropdownItem>
                    Settings
                  </DropdownItem>
                  <DropdownItem divider />
                  <DropdownItem>
                    Logout
                  </DropdownItem>
                </DropdownMenu>
              </UncontrolledDropdown>
            </Nav>
          </Collapse>
        </Navbar>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

### 2. Modal Window

This component of the Reactstrap modal helps in creating the modal of Bootstrap, taking in use the body, header and footer.

Callbacks and some props are accepted by the modal in order to add interactive feature to the window, and in addition to making it closable.

The visibility of the modal is dependent on the `isOpen` prop. When it comes to the component for controlling, the `togglecallback` is used, so as to toggle the isOpen’s value.

Transition effects are added with the help of various other props. If you talk about the callbacks, they are `onClosed`, `OnEnter`, `onOpened` and `onExit`.


```javascript
{/*For the modal to open, this.state.show should become true which is usually triggered by an onClick event */}
{/* toggleModal would set state of show to false onClose*/}

<Modal isOpen = {this.state.show} toggle = {this.toggleModal} >

    <ModalHeader toggle = {this.toggle} >
        Modal title
    </ModalHeader >

    <ModalBody >
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod
		tempor incididunt ut labore dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, 
		quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nii ut af ex ea commodo consequat.
    </ModalBody >

    <ModalFooter >
        <Button color = "primary" onClick = {this.toggle} > Do Something </Button >{' '}
        <Button color="secondary" onClick = {this.toggle}> Cancel </Button >
     </ModalFooter >
</Modal >
```

### 3. Forms
As far as the Reactstrap `<Form>` is concerned, it could be horizontal or inline.

For rendering an `<input>` element, the input component is taken in use. Numerous  input components, can be wrapped for features like accessing the features of `FormGroup`, ensuring state validation and ensuring proper space into a `FormGroup`.

You should try setting label making use of `<Label>` as it is indeed a good option. If you wish to learn more about forms, then it’s better to go for its Bootstrap documentation.

The code for the same is given below:


```javascript
 <Form >
   <FormGroup row >
      <Label for = "exampleEmail" sm = {2} > Email </Label >
      <Col sm = {10} >
          <Input type = "email" name = "email" id = "exampleEmail" placeholder = "with a placeholder" />
      </Col >
   </FormGroup >

   <FormGroup row >
      <Label for = "examplePassword" sm = {2} > Password </Label >
      <Col sm = {10} >
         <Input type = "password" name = "password" id = "examplePassword" placeholder = "password placeholder" />
      </Col >
   </FormGroup >

   <FormGroup row >
      <Label for = "exampleSelect" sm = {2} >Select </Label >
      <Col sm = {10} >
          <Input type = "select" name = "select" id = "exampleSelect" />
      </Col >
   </FormGroup >

   <FormGroup row >
      <Label for = "exampleSelectMulti" sm = {2} > Select Multiple </Label >
      <Col sm = {10} >
        <Input type = "select" name = "selectMulti" id = "exampleSelectMulti" multiple />
      </Col >
    </FormGroup >

  <FormGroup row >
    <Label for = "exampleText" sm = {2} >Text Area </Label >
    <Col sm = {10} >
      <Input type = "textarea" name = "text" id = "exampleText" />
    </Col >
  </FormGroup >
</Form >
```

### 4. ListGroup
If you want to control or style the React’s list items, then you can make use of the ListGrop of Reactstrap that helps in simplifying the process. The ListGroup again results in wrapping the ListGroupItems, so as to make them interactive with the help of `onClick` callback. 

The Code for the same is as under:


```javascript
<ListGroup >
  <ListGroupItem > Item 1 </ListGroupItem >
  <ListGroupItem > Item 2 </ListGroupItem >
  <ListGroupItem > ... </ListGroupItem >
</ListGroup >;
```

### 5. Buttons
For any kind of designing framework, buttons constitute an important part. You have the component of Reactstrap `<Button>` for the buttons. Besides the disabled and active properties, developers can make use of size and color in order to fix the style of button. 


```javascript
{/*ButtonToolbar helps to organize buttons */}
 <div>
    <Button color="primary">primary</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="secondary">secondary</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="success">success</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="info">info</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="warning">warning</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="danger">danger</Button>{' '}
    <Button color="link">link</Button>
 </div>
```

## Demo: Application UI Contact List with Reactstrap
Let’s have a look at the demo prepared making in use of the components that are mentioned in the [first]() and the [second]() guide.

You should try and do experiment on it, to make yourself acquainted with the concept of Reactstrap:


```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));
```

Here's the sample [output](https://xyjx85kyw.codesandbox.io/). To get the complete code along with directory structure, you can refer the [given](https://codesandbox.io/s/xyjx85kyw?from-embed) resource.

## Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned about few of the available components in Reactstrap library, ending the guide with a contact list demo.
