## Introduction
The animators and programmers who have spent some time in the industry would be well aware of the fact that React component is one of formidable platforms. One of the key reasons for that is the implementation of a browser independent Document Object Model (DOM) system in order to ensure performance as well as the cross browser compatibility. 

In this guide, our objective is to go through the DOM properties and see the ways of generating inline font-size style with React JS. 

## DOM Elements
When as a developer you are working with the React JS, it is critical to understand that all DOM attributes and properties should be in `camelCased`. The event handlers are also not an exception to it. 
For instance, HTML attribute like `tabindex` corresponds to `tabindex` attribute in React. Here, the exception is `aria-*` as well as `data-*` attributes. These attributes should be in lowercase. 

While generating inline font size style using React, there are multiple attributes that operate in different fashion in between HTML and React. 

### The checked Attribute 
The checked is an attribute upheld by `<input>` elements of type checkbox and/ or radio. You can apply it in order to set rather the component has been checked. The step is helpful in constructing controlled components. Here,`defaultChecked`, a form of uncontrolled equivalent decides whether component is checked at the time when first mounted or not.

### The className Attribute
In order to identify a specific CSS class, apply `className` attribute. It applies in all types of standard Document Object Model and Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) components such as `<div>`, `<a>`, etc. If as a user you apply React with the Web elements, then it is advisable to rather go for the `class` attribute. 

### The dangerouslySetInnerHTML Attribute
The `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` attribute is used as a replacement for React’s `innerHTML` while going with the browser Document Object Model (DOM). When we talk in the standard terms, setting HTML from code is kind of risky due to the fact that it simply exposes users to a kind of cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. Under such circumstances, the user can set the concerned HTML straight from React JS. Here, it is critical for the user to type in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and then pass on an object via a `__html` key. 

Let's understand this with the help of following example:


```javascript
function createMarkup() {
  return {__html: 'First &middot; Second'};
}

function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML = {createMarkup()} />;
}
```

### The htmlFor Attribute 
As `for` is basically reserved for JavaScript, the elements of React JS rather apply `htmlFor`.

### The onChange Attribute 
The event responds as the user anticipates it to be i.e. the event is triggered whenever form field is altered. The user will voluntarily apply current browser behaviour as `onChange` is a form of incongruity for its responsiveness as well as React JS depends on event to improvise the user input on a real time basis. 
Selected 
Please note that selected attribute is rendered support via <option> elements. The application of this attribute is usually done to set rather the component is chosen or not. It is very effective in order to create controlled elements. 
Style 
Some of the leading examples documentation applies style in order to achieve convenience, but it is worth mentioning that the application of styleattribute as one of the key methods of styling the elements is not suggestive. In the maximum amout of cases, the classname is recommended to be applied as external form of CSS stylesheet. Style component is generally applied in React apps to include dynamic computer animated styles at the stipulated rendered time. In general working proportions, style accepts a JS object carrying camelCased features instead of CSS string. The feature is persistent with Document Object Model form of style JS property. It is more effective and prevents loopholes in XSS security measures. For instance;
