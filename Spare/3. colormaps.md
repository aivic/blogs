## Introduction
After going through this guide, you will be able to integrate Bootstrap along with React, allowing the you to make use of the exclusive grid system of the Bootstrap as well as its other crucial components. 

The guide is in series with [Integrating Bootstrap and React - Part 2](). By the end of these guides, you would have explored all techniques and tools that are crucial in developing the user interface along with the appearance of Bootstrap for the web application that is powered by React. 

## Creating an Application for Contact List of React Using Reactstrap

When it comes to web applications that are highly interactive, React is such a JavaScript technology that has a very crucial role to play. The main reason why it is considered crucial is mainly because of the algorithm that is very fast rendering, modular approach that is based on component and composing ability.

Also, it is important to note that there are few drawbacks with this technology. For instance, you won’t be able to find the built-in mechanism with React as it is a view library. Thus, you may find it hard to generate designs which are intuitive, responsive and sleek. It is here the role of _Bootstrap_ - one of a front end framework of design comes into picture.

## Problem While Including Bootstrap Components with React

The question arises why it is not considered a good option to include the components of Bootstrap with the React. Let’s get an answer to this. 

If you think the combination of Bootstrap along with React is as simple as adding `<link rel = "stylesheet" />` to a file like `index.html`, then you are completely wrong. It is so because, the dependency of Bootstrap is on `jQuery` in respect of powering the components of UI. The approach Direct DOM manipulation is used by jQuery which is actually contradictory to the declaration approach of React. 

In case the use of Bootstrap is restricted to 12 column responsive grip or for any of the parts that don’t make use of jQuery, then a developer can simply switch to vanilla Bootstrap style sheet. It is so because, you will find a substantial number of libraries that help in clearing the space between Bootstrap and React. Let’s take a comparison of both the technique so that you can judge the utility of approach that suits best to your requirements. 

Here’s how to proceed!

## How To Set Up Stylesheet of Bootstrap Along With React?

To begin with, it is important to make use of Create React App in order to prepare a zero configuration based React project initially.

First of all, you need to create a React App. Thereafter, you need to make use of the below given command in order to initiate a novel project and move ahead:


```
$ create-react-app react-and-bootstrap
$ cd react-and-bootstrap
$ npm start
```

After you give the command, Create React App will form a directory structure, which should look like as under:


```
├── package.json
├── public
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
├── README.md
├── src
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── App.js
│   ├── App.test.js
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.js
│   ├── logo.svg
│   └── registerServiceWorker.js
└── yarn.lock
```

Once done, you are required to download the Bootstrap library’s latest version from the official site of the Bootstrap. It is important to note here that, both the minified and compiled versions of JavaScript and CSS are included in the package. All you are required to do is to simply copy CSS and put it within the `public/directory`. In case, there are projects that make use of the grid, then you need not to worry as there is an option of the inclusion of the stylesheet that is grid specified. 

Moving ahead, inside `public/`, you need to prepare a novel directory for the css. Next, you should paste `bootstrap.min.css` in the css directory that is newly built. Finally, you should link the same from `public/index.html`. Here’s the code for the same:


```html
<head>
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "css/bootstrap.min.css">
</head>
```

It is not necessary to follow the above method only, you may make use of CDN in order to get minified CSS fetched. Here’s the code for the same:


```html
<link rel = "stylesheet" href = "https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css">
```

Let us get to the inference to acknowledge what results worked and what not with this setup.

## Making Use of Vanilla Bootstrap Along With the React

After the Bootstrap style sheet is added to the React project, you can make use of the normal Bootstrap classes within the code of JSX. Thereafter, proceed to the demo site of the Bootstrap and copy any kind of example code randomly. This activity is just to make sure, how the resultant would be:


```javascript
import React from "react";
import { render } from "react-dom";
import NavBar from "./NavBar";
import Forms from "./Forms";

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <NavBar />
    <br />
    <div className = "container">
      <div className = "row">
        <div className = " col-lg-offset-2 col-lg-10">
          <Forms />
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
);

render(<App />, document.getElementById("root"));

```

[![Nav](https://i.imgur.com/9MpG4z1.jpg)](https://9y8qq85qqo.codesandbox.io/)

So, now you can perceive form which appears good, however that is not the case with `NavBar`. This is because this bar is dependent on the plugin of `Collapse jQuery`, which is not imported yet. Due to this, it is difficult to toggle the navigation links. Not just that, you may find it hard to make use of features like modal windows, dropdown menus and closable alerts etc. 

Don’t you think, it’s great to import the Bootstrap as components of React in order to make the best out of it? To illustrate it better, suppose you can make use of the components of Row, Grid and Column combination for organizing the page, without using the HTML classes. It should look something like below:


```html
<!-- Bootstrap with HTML classes -->

<div class = "container">
  <div class = "row">
    <div class = "col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class = "col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
    <div class = "col-sm">
      One of three columns
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<!-- Bootstrap with React Components -->

<Grid>
  <Row>
      <Col sm>
        One of three columns
    </Col>
    <Col sm>
        One of three columns
    </Col>
     <Col sm>
        One of three columns
    </Col>
  </Row>
</Grid>
```

It is good that for serving this purpose you are not required to implement the library of your own. It is so because; you will find a good number of solutions that are readily available. 

## Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned about the basic integration of React with Bootstrap. In the next guide, [Integrating Bootstrap and React - Part 2]() we will look at the insight of the libraries of the third party for Bootstrap and React, setting up the library of Reactstrap, Bootsrap grid basics, and much more.
