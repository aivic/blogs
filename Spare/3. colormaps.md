## Introduction
In this guide you will learn about the Matplotlib built-in colormaps as well as creating and customizing them as per your needs.

After completing this guide, you will be able to do the followings:
1. Selecting colormaps 
2. Customizing colormaps
3. Creating colormaps

## The Baseline
Throughout this guide we will be using the following libraries:

**Syntax**

```python
# Importing necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mpl
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

## Selecting colormaps
Just like any other Python visualization library, Matplotlib also has many built-in colormaps which are accessible using `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`. 

We can access the values stored in each colormap in terms of RGBA values as shown:


```python
# Accessing three values from the Pastel1 colormap
plt.cm.get_cmap('Pastel1', 3).colors

# Output
# array([[ 0.98431373, 0.70588235, 0.68235294, 1. ],
#        [ 0.99607843, 0.85098039, 0.65098039, 1. ],
#        [ 0.94901961, 0.94901961, 0.94901961, 1. ]])
```

As per the available [resources](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html#classes-of-colormaps), colormaps are often split into several categories based on their function:

| **Colormap** | **Function** | **Usage** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Sequential | Changes in lightness and often saturation of color incrementally, often using a single hue | For representing information that has ordering |
| Diverging | Change in lightness and possibly saturation of two different colors that meet in the middle at an unsaturated color | When the information being plotted has a critical middle value, such as topography or when the data deviates around zero |
| Cyclic | Changes in lightness of two different colors that meet in the middle and beginning/end at an unsaturated color | For values that wrap around at the endpoints, such as phase angle, wind direction, or time of day |
| Qualitative | Often are miscellaneous colors | To represent information which does not have ordering or relationships |

Let us learn to implement each one of these colormap through some data:


```python
# Setting the figure size 
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x1 = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y1 = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
x2 = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y2 = np.linspace(5,-5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Sequential Colormap
ax1 = fig.add_subplot(221)
ax1.scatter(x1, y1, c=x1, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('magma'))
ax1.set_title('Sequential: magma', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Diverging Colormap
ax2 = fig.add_subplot(222)
ax2.scatter(x2, y2, c=x2, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('coolwarm'))
ax2.set_title('Diverging: coolwarm', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Cyclic Colormap
ax3 = fig.add_subplot(223)
ax3.scatter(x1, y1, c=x1, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('hsv'))
ax3.set_xlabel('Cyclic: hsv', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Qualitative Colormap
ax4 = fig.add_subplot(224)
ax4.scatter(x2, y2, c=x2, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('Dark2'))
ax4.set_xlabel('Qualitative: Dark2', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Displaying the figure
plt.show()
```

## Customizing Colormaps

By default the details of a colormap is obtained from the attached colarbar as shown:


```python
# Setting the figure size
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Plotting
fig = plt.scatter(x, y, c=x, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('Spectral'))
plt.colorbar(fig)

# Labelling the title
plt.title('A figure with colormap and a colorbar', weight='bold', fontsize=18)

# Displaying the plot
plt.show()
```

The colorbar in the above figure shows that as the value falls below zero, it tends to become more red whereas as the value rises upwards it tends to become blue.

However, it is not always necessary to use the predefined colorbar. We can change it as per our needs. We will look at two such scnearios when we can modify the existing colorbar:
1. Normalizing the continuous colorbar
2. Setting discrete colorbar

### Normalizing the Continuous Colorbar

We can normalize the colorbar in a given range by using `matplotlib.colors.Normalize` and later using it inside the `norm` argument of `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase` method. 
Let us use the `Pink` colormap which falls under the Sequetial category and normalize it in a range of (5, 10): 


```python
# Setting the figure size 
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(8, 5), gridspec_kw = {'width_ratios':[3, 0.1]})

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x1 = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y1 = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Defining Colormap
ax1.scatter(x1, y1, c=x1, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('pink'))
ax1.set_title('Normalized colorbar', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Defining Colorbar
norm = mpl.colors.Normalize(vmin=5, vmax=10)
mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax2, cmap=plt.cm.get_cmap('pink'), norm=norm) 

# Displaying the figure
plt.show()
```

### Setting Discrete Colorbar
Sometimes, we may want to set a specific intervals in a colorbar to represent the vastness of a particular sample over another. This can again be achieved using the `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase` method. 

Let us take four colors and build a colormap using them via `matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap` method and set a bound to each color as **[1, 2, 6, 8]**:


```python
# Setting the figure size 
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(8, 5), gridspec_kw = {'width_ratios':[3, 0.1]})

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x1 = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y1 = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Initializing colors and building a colormap
cmap = mpl.colors.ListedColormap(['red', 'green', 'blue', 'cyan'])

# Setting the Colormap
ax1.scatter(x1, y1, c=x1, cmap=cmap)
ax1.set_title('A Figure with a Discrete Colorbar', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Setting the Discrete Colorbar
bounds = [1, 2, 6, 8]
mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax2, cmap=cmap,
                                boundaries=[0] + bounds + [10],
                                extend='both',
                                ticks=bounds,spacing='proportional') 

# Displaying the figure
plt.show()
```

## Creating Colormaps
As we have seen in the last example that we have created our own colormap using four colors via the `matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap` method. Let us briefly learn how to create your own colormaps using two approches:
1. Listed Colormap
2. Linear Segmented Colormap

### Listed Colormap
Since we have already utilized the `matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap` method by passing a list of color names to form a colormap so let's learn in what other ways can we benefit from this method. 
First, we can concatenate multiple colormaps together to form a new colormap. Let us concatenate `Greys` and `Blues` colormaps together:


```python
# Setting the figure size 
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(8, 5), gridspec_kw = {'width_ratios':[3, 0.1]})

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Concatenating colormaps
top = plt.cm.get_cmap('Greys', 128)
bottom = plt.cm.get_cmap('Blues', 128)

newcolors = np.vstack((top(np.linspace(0, 1, 128)),
                       bottom(np.linspace(0, 1, 128))))
cmap = mpl.colors.ListedColormap(newcolors, name='GreyBlue')

# Colormap
ax1.scatter(x, y, c=x, cmap=cmap)
ax1.set_title('Concatenated colormaps', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Normalized Colorbar
norm = mpl.colors.Normalize(vmin=5, vmax=10)
mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax2, cmap=cmap, norm=norm) 

# Displaying the figure
plt.show()
```

Second, we can even create our own colormap by passing the values to a NumPy array and concatenating with any built-in colormap.

### Linear Segmented Colormap

Linear Segmented Colormap specifies colormaps using anchor points between which RGB(A) values are interpolated.
Let us take an example where we build a colormap using custom colors provided in the list of tuples along with the anchor points corresponding to each color.


```python
# Setting the figure size 
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(8, 5), gridspec_kw = {'width_ratios':[3, 0.1]})

# Initializing the data
num = 1000
x = np.linspace(-0.5,1,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))
y = np.linspace(-5,5,num) + (0.5 - np.random.rand(num))

# Concatenating colormaps
cmap = mpl.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.from_list('custom', 
                                             [(0,    'red'),
                                              (0.5, 'green'),
                                              (1,    'Orange')], N=126)

# Defining Colormap
ax1.scatter(x, y, c=x, cmap=cmap)
ax1.set_title('Linear Segmented colormaps', fontsize=16, weight='bold')

# Defining Colorbar
norm = mpl.colors.Normalize(vmin=2, vmax=10)
mpl.colorbar.ColorbarBase(ax2, cmap=cmap, norm=norm) 

# Displaying the figure
plt.show()
```
