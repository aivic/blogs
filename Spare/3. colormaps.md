## Introduction
This guide is the second part of the series _Integrating Bootstrap with React_. To learn about the basic integration of Bootstrap with React, you can refer the first guide, [Integrating Bootstrap with React - Part 1]().

In this successive guide, you will learn about the third-party libraries for React and Bootstrap.


## The Baseline
In order to create Bootstrap implementation that is React specific, there are some libraries available that allow the use of the components of JSX with the styles of Bootstrap. In this guide, we dicuss some of the modules of Bootstrap that can be used with the projects based on React. 

If we talk about the libraries that are considered popular for adding the components of Bootstrap into the React, then React-Bootstrap has its own position. Please note, however, here Bootstrap v3 is targeted instead of the Bootstrap’s new or the most advanced version.

For using the components of Bootstrap in React, there’s another library by the name of `Reactstrap`. As React-Bootstrap is not built for supporting the Bootstrap’s latest version, that is not the case with Reactstrap. You can easily find the typography components, layout grids, buttons, forms, icons and tables in the module. Since it is in the developing phase, and is it basically a good alternative for preparing the Bootstrap apps that are based on React, you can find it getting popular day by day. 

If you wish to get extended support for the creation of React based UIs then you may opt for a number of libraries, for example, React UI, and the modules that are specific to domain. For instance, table based on React Bootstrap, React UI and React Admin Panel based on CoreUI available on the GitHub.

The remaining part of this guide is going to emphasize on Reactstrap. It is so because; it is fully compatible with the Bootstrap’s latest version.

## Setting Up the Library on Reactstrap

Initially, you need to do the installation of the Reactstrap library, taking in use of `npm`. We start by installing the reactstrap library using npm:


```sh
npm install --save reactstrap@next
```

Once done, you need to import all the components that are relevant from the module itself. Here’s the code for that:


```javascript
import { Container, Row, Col} from 'reactstrap';
```

But, if you think this will make library work, then you are wrong. The reason for the same is already given on the official website of the Reactstrap. It simply says, Bootstrap CSS is not included in the Reactstrap and that’s why we need to do the same manually.


```sh
npm install --save bootstrap
```

Once done, the Bootstrap CSS needs to be imported in the file of the `src/index.js`:


```javascript
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

## The Basics of Bootstrap Grid

An important feature of Bootstrap is that it has mobile first, responsive as well as fluid grid system, with the help of which, you can create as many as 12 columns for every page. The container is required to be imported along with the `Col` components and Row, so as to make use of the grid. 

A fluid property that leads to the conversion of layout of fixed width into the full one is accepted by the container. Importantly, it results in the addition of Bootstrap class with `.container-fluid` to the grid. 

`<Col>`s  need to be configured to allow `props` like `lg`, `md`, `xs` and `sm`, which are actually equal too the `col-*` classes of Bootstrap. For instance, `<Col xs="6"> </Col>`.

If you don’t wish to go for above, then you can try passing object with a number of optional properties to the `props`, like `offset`, `size` and `order`. The columns’ number is described by the size property, whereas the columns’ order is ascertained by order and even helps in choosing one value from 1-12. If you wish the columns to move right, then this role is entrusted to the offset property.

Here’s the code showing few of the Reactstrap’s Grid features.
