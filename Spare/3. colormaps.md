## Introduction
When you are looking for the inline style components then there are so many options to choose from that you can choose to experiment with your work to attain assured results. 

Yes, trial and error is always an option but if you are working with a stiff deadline and anticipating a refined result then it is obvious that you are well familiar with the grass root level concepts associated with animation and programming. In this guide, you will understand how React JS component work with inline style and what are the ideal practices that you can come across and how to opt for the right one as per your situational needs and requirements.

## The Application
The React JS component is a common choice for both budding and veteran professionals in the field of animation. It is due to this very reason that you can find a plethora of choice in terms of the elements that are accessible in its libraries. 

When you are trying to specify the style pertaining to the React classes, the code can be written as:


```javascript
var MyDiv = React.createClass({
  render: function() {
    var style = {
      color: 'white',
      fontSize: 200
    };

    return <div style = { style } > It is a delicious food! </div>;
  }
});
```

Now, when you go through the programming then you are going to find that there are multiple questions that come in the mind. For example, is it necessary or advisable to do all the styling in this manner or rather no style to be mentioned in CSS file? Is it suggestive to shun the inline styles absolutely? Or can one incorporate both? 

Well, the good news is that if these questions are crossing your mind then you need not to get bothered at all. A smart and rational person is ought to ask such questions. That is the reason why we are going to discussing the subject in this guide and help you reach a conclusive choice. 

For those who are in the search of best approaches in React JS inline style, there are certain best practices that are worth mentioning. 

When we look around the library comparison of React inline style then following are the approaches that can enable you to make prudent choice.

## All (Or Nothing)? 
The following are certain components that actually integrate to form `style`:
- **Appearance**: Features and characteristics associated with the component or element. 
- **Layout**: Where actually a particular component or element stands in relationship with others. 
- **The Behaviour and the State**: How a component or element appears in a particularly given state.


## Commencing with state-styles  
It is essential to understand that React JS is a platform which is already taking care of the state of your elements. That is the reason why styles of the state and behaviour make them a natural pair to coexist with component logic. Here, you have the option to incorporate state-styles in a direct manner rather than creating components rendering conditional state classes. 


```javascript
// Typical component with state-classes
<li 
 className={classnames({ 'todo-list__item': true, 'is-complete': item.complete })} />


// Using inline-styles for state
<li className='todo-list__item'
 style={(item.complete) ? styles.complete : {}} />
```

Here, it is crucial to note that the application of a class to get style appearance is no longer dependent on any sort of `.is-` prefixed state class meant for state and behaviour.

You can apply `Object.assign` or rather `_.extend` to include support to avail multiple states:


```javascript
// Supporting multiple-states with inline-styles
<li 'todo-list__item'
 style={Object.assign({}, item.complete && styles.complete, item.due && styles.due )}>
```

## Reusability and Customization
Here, the application of `Object.assign` is going to take place making it simple for our concerned component to be reusable along with various styles. In order to overrule the concerned default styles, you can execute call-site with props, such as: `<TodoItem dueStyle={ fontWeight: "bold" } />`. It is going to be applied in the following manner:


```javascript
<li 'todo-list__item'
 style={ Object.assign({},
         item.due && styles.due,
         item.due && this.props.dueStyles) } >
```

## The Layout
If you are seeking a personal opinion then I would say that there is no concrete reason making inline layout styles. One can easily find several remarkable CSS layouts in the library. Simply use one to avail the results.

It is suggestive not to include layout styles to the component in a direct form. Simply wrap down the components along with the layout components. For instance:


```javascript
// This couples your component to the layout system
// It reduces the reusability of your component
<UserBadge
 className = "col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8"
 firstName = "X"
 lastName = "Y" />

// This is much easier to maintain and change
<div class = "col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-8">
  <UserBadge
   firstName = "X"
   lastName = "Y" />
</ div>
```

In order to render support to the layout, the design components have to be of 100% height and width. 

## The Appearance
The feature is arguably the most belligerent zone of "inline-style" discussion. In the end, it is about the element of your designing as well as the compatibility of your workforce operating with JS.

Here, one aspect is quite certain that you'll be requiring help from a library. The states of browser (`:hover`, `:focus`), as well as media-queries remain a daunting task in terms of raw React JS. 

## The Code Organization
Usually, you are going to find a style object located outside of module. In case of such a todo-list element, it would appear something like the following:


```javascript
var styles = {
  root: {
    display: "block"
  },
  item: {
    color: "black"

    complete: {
      textDecoration: "line-through"
    },

    due: {
      color: "red"
    }
  },
}
```

## The getter functions
The creation of the getter functions in order to compute styles is going to appear like the following:


```javascript
React.createClass({
  getStyles: function () {
    return Object.assign(
      {},
      item.props.complete && styles.complete,
      item.props.due && styles.due,
      item.props.due && this.props.dueStyles
    );
  },

  render: function () {
    return <li style = { this.getStyles()}>{this.props.item }</ li>
  }
});
```

## Conclusion
This guide has successfully incorporated the best practices in React JS inline style. Right from the state-styles to the customization as well as the layout, appearance and the getter functions there is nothing vital that has been excluded.

Go through them and add new dimensions to your creative style component. Feedbacks are always welcome!
