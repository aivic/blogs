## Introduction
The application of the React JS component for the purpose of animation is one of the popular subjects that the developers always seek to explore. It is basically because on CSS Render it is not only easier to execute simple to complex animations but the developers can always challenge their skills miles ahead by exploring new things.

Here, in this guide our objective will be to learn how to animate a React JS component on Render with CSS and how to fetch a product which could turn out to be even better than your imagination. For the developers, it is essential to understand that in order to create complex animations there are several effective platforms that could aid you in one way or the other. One such platform that could help you with a diverse numbers of components in animation is GreenSock. In the contemporary world of CSS animation, GreenSock is one of the most formidable and acclaimed animation platforms. In order to create animation in React, there are many components and libraries that are accessible with this platform. 

## The CSS Method of Animating a React JS Component on Render 
The application of CSS method is usually done when the developer is aiming for a simple type of animation. One of the key reasons why both the novice and the professional developers implement CSS method rather than importing the javascript libraries is due to the fact that the overall bundle will remain small. As the bundle will remain small in size without compromising with the overall quality, the rendering of the testing as well as the final product would be much easier. Apart from that, the browser that the developer is working upon will spend fewer resources. 

When you are working upon the animation of a React app then the rendering size as well as the resource browser is a critical component impacting the efficiency and the output of the app. The CSS method will have certain limitation as the method is primarily application for the creation of simple type of animation and the developer is keen to render a small size bundle. 

It is an undeniable fact that while navigating an animation guide, it is essential to come across some of the examples related to CSS animation. Here, we would try to understand how the basic animation is done with CSS. Let us take an example on given image, when you click on the navigation bar it helps to hide and show the given text.

It is one of the common features that you can observe in the apps which scrolling and exploring the bars on fingertips. The menu flashes once you click on the icon as can be observed in the next image below:

![Eg](https://i.imgur.com/EnhE36j.png)

The menu list flashes on the screen once the icon is clicked. It is one of the simplest forms of animations in the app that we usually observe and use on regular basis. 

When this type of menu is put into function then the user will basically find it easier to click and explore. The complex structure of the whole app is created by the developer with the help of these slick and simple animation works and compiling them together. 

The CSS property ensures that the menu remains easy to use and for the html tag it can trigger `“className = ”is-nav-open.”`

The above animation example can be implemented in a numerous ways. One of the ways is to form a wrapper over the navigation and then to trigger the changes in the margin. The constant width of the navigation is equal to 250px. In addition to that, the wrapper with the margin-left or the translateX property will be in the identical width. For the sake of the developers to access good results, it is essential to display the navigation in a proper way. Here, one can do it easily by adding `className = "is-nav-open"` as it is for the wrapper and in order to move the wrapper on `margin-left/translateX: 0;` one can use the following set of codes as displayed in the codeblok below:


```javascript
export default class ExampleCss extends Component {
	handleClick ( ) {
		const wrapper = document.getElementById('wrapper');
		wrapper.classList.toggle('is-nav-open')
	}
	render ( ) {
	return (
		<div id = "wrapper" className = "wrapper" >
			<div className = "nav" >
				<Icon
					className = "nav__icon"
					type = "menu-fold"
					onClick = {( )} => this.handleClick()}
				/>
			<div className = "nav__body" >
			Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Nullam at bibendum erat, aliquam vehicula nisi. Maecenas ex urna, imperdiet semper luctus nec, rutrum a urna. Donec vulputate lorem tortor, vitae dapibus tellus sodales quis
			</ div>
			</ div>
		</ div>
	);
	}
}
```

For the CSS method, there are certain more codes that are required to be taken into account. These codes can be seen and implemented in the codeblock provided below:


```css
.wrapper {
	display: flex;
	width: 100%;
	height: 100%;
	transition: margin .5s;
	margin: 0 0 0 -250px;
}

.wrapper .is-nav-open {
	margin-left: 0;
}

.nav {
	position: relative;
	width: 250px;
	height: 100%;
	padding: 20px;
	border-right: 1px solid #ccc;
}

.nav__icon {
	position: absolute;
	top: 0;
	right: -60px;
	padding: 20px;
	font-size: 20px;
	cursor: pointer;
	transition: color .3s;
}

.nav__icon:hover {
	color: #5eb2ff;
}
```


These codes are basically associated with CSS styles and will help the developer with the adjustment of the margins, font size and the overall transition. 

As a developer, when we talk from the viewpoint of most of the situations then it is obvious that the above mentioned approach is quite effective. As a professional developer expecting faster and seamless results, there is no harm in writing a number of CSS lines and then triggering the className. It is a lot more comforting and easier than importing large size libraries and executing them in your projects. 

It is true that when you are developing an app then it is essential to be familiar with the likes and dislikes of your potential users. If you are familiar with their preferences and the elements that they would like to shun then it would not be hard for you to generate the desired user base within a short span of time. When your existing and potential users will realize that your browser reproduces the app at a faster pace then it would only bring your work in a positive light.

## Conclusion
The CSS method and style will help you to get the animation at a faster pace. Yes, the level of React JS component on Render will have certain limitations as you cannot add complex transition elements to the page. At the same time, it can turn out to be a blessing in disguise as it will encourage you to introduce simple transition in app functioning.
