## Introduction
In CSS animation, the transition effects play a crucial role to render the desired results. It doesn't take much time for a coder to realize that the appropriate fade in and fade out features are necessary to render the standard animation process for a desired outcome. 

## Common Pitfalls, and Correct Procedure 
Most of the professional coders will go with the following code in order to make image alteration in their SRC on hover. 


```javascript
$(".social").on({
    mouseenter: function () {
        $(this).data("original-src", $(this).attr("src"))
            .fadeOut(250, function () {
            $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-src"));
        }).fadeIn(250);
    },
    mouseleave: function () {
        $(this).fadeOut(250, function () {
            $(this).attr("src", $(this).data("original-src"));
        }).fadeIn(250);
    }
});
```

It is feasible for you to clear out the animation queue by the time you mouse enter and thereafter form animations again.


```javascript
$(".social").on({
    mouseenter: function () {
        $(this).data("original-src", $(this).attr("src"))
            .stop(true, true).fadeOut(250, function () {
            $(this).attr("src", $(this).attr("data-src"));
        }).fadeIn(250);
    },
    mouseleave: function () {
        $(this).stop(true, true).fadeOut(250, function () {
            $(this).attr("src", $(this).data("original-src"));
        }).fadeIn(250);
    }
});
```

Now in the usual scenario, when the user hover on and off for sometimes, it wobbles back and forth for a period of 3 to 4 seconds. It is the time taken to complete all fade in/ fade out effects. These errors are generally prevented with `.stop()`. One can remove the fade in if one hovers off the button prior to the command `$(".txtWrap").stop().hover()` as shown:


```javascript
$(".txtWrap").stop().hover(
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').fadeOut();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').fadeIn();

  },
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').fadeIn();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').fadeOut();
  }
)
```

In case if an error is returned indicating that the `stop()` is placed incorrectly then the following codes can be tried:


```javascript
$(".txtWrap").hover(
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').stop().fadeOut();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').fadeIn();
  //  $('#timeTxt').fadeOut();
  //  $('#timeTxtDesc').fadeIn();

  },
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').fadeIn();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').stop().fadeOut();
  }
)
```

## Removing Opacity Without Hiding the Element 
If you encounter the problem with element’s opacity then it is feasible for you as a user to handle the issue without concealing the actual element. If you prefer to keep them concealed then you can use `.hide()` and you will be required to include a callback to the transition function. 


```javascript
$(".txtWrap").hover(
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').stop().animate({opacity:0}, 500);
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').animate({opacity:1}, 500);
  //  $('#timeTxt').fadeOut();
  //  $('#timeTxtDesc').fadeIn();

  },
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').animate({opacity:1}, 500);
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').stop().animate({opacity:0}, 500);
  }
)
```

Apart from that, you can also give consideration to `.hoverIntent()` plugin which has proven to be seamless. It is flexible and the configuration can be customized as per your need and convenience.  

All that is required to do is to include the plugin and contain the word `Intent`.


```javascript
$(".txtWrap").hoverIntent(
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').fadeOut();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').fadeIn();

  },
  function () {
    $(this).find('.txtBock').fadeIn();
    $(this).find('.txtDesc').fadeOut();
  }
)
```

Some of the coders complain in general sense that while trying to reset CSS Fadein they end up with the following instruction:


```javascript
$("#frase1").fadeIn(5000, function() {
   $("#frase2").fadeIn(10000, function() {
      $("#frase3").fadeIn(15000, function() {
      });
  });
});
```

In such a case, it is advisable to use the following instruction in order to reset CSS Fadein or any other sort of event in the queue:


```javascript
$("#frase1").stop(false, true, true);
$("#frase2").stop(false, true, true);
$("#frase3").stop(false, true, true);
```

## An Application of jQuery in Fading in/out Onmouse Hover
In the cases of onmouse hover, the challenge that the coders usually face is that the HTML objects spontaneously fade in or out whenever they scroll the mouse over them.  

In order to toggle this fade in or fade out, you can use close button when the mouse is specifically over that particular element. Additionally, if you wish to fade in an upload button then the mouse can be run over the profile icon. 

In the initial stages, the application of jQuery fadeIn and fadeOut approach tends to work swiftly and seamlessly. However, it is when the user quickly toggles among the two when the presence of a certain bug starts creating problems. 

It can be well understood from the code mentioned below:


```javascript
$('.hiddenFormMouseover').mouseenter(function() {
    $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeIn();
});
$('.hiddenFormMouseover').mouseleave(function() {
    $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeOut();
});
```

Here, while taking a small glance on the code, everything seems to be normal. But when a person tries to run the mouse over and out of object in a quick fashion, one can observe the fact that in spite of holding the movement of mouse, the object relentlessly remains fade in and fade out for the same number of times the movement of the mouse has taken over it. It is basically happening due to the reason that the functions are tossed every time they are under the movement of user’s mouse. Here, one is required to wait for the completion of the previous function prior to the execution of the present one. If the movement of the mouse is taking place at a quick pace than the time taken for the object to fade then it will remain in oscillation even after the completion of the function. 

It is the basic result which is rendered for jQuery, but it is possibly not the one that you wish to have for your interface. If the movement of the mouse is on the object then it is expected to instantly fade in and stop.

A coder can try a few of the various combinations of additional components into functions such as jQuery `stop()` (removing the fade in/ out presently in progress); thereafter passing 0  as the kind of time argument to the user’s fade functions (such as fadeout (0) resulting in the immediate fade out of the object. The user can continue to avail slightly better still not the ideal behaviour, such as stopping objects through half opaque rather than continuous oscillation. It is continuously done till the user can get the pertinent results.

At the time when the cursor accesses the object, you can wish the object to discontinue any other type of fading it might be undertaking and successfully run the complete fadeIn animation. In the meantime, the cursor departs the coder would anticipate a reverse outcome i.e., stop fading and thereafter run a complete fadeOut.

Mentioning the program in javascript, as the programmers, we can observe a spontaneously behaving outcome:


```javascript
$('.hiddenFormMouseover').mouseenter(function() {
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').stop();
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeOut(0);
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeIn();
});

$('.hiddenFormMouseover').mouseleave(function() {
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').stop();
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeIn(0);
  $(this).children('.hiddenFormMouseoverButton').fadeOut();
});
```

From the above mentioned code, it is quite clear that while implementing a simple concept, it is important that the execution remains precise otherwise a sequence of new programs would become necessary to eliminate the bug generated. 


```javascript
$(document).ready(function() {
$("img").on({
  mouseenter: function() {
    $(this).css("opacity", "0.5")
  },
  mouseleave: function() {
    $(this).css("opacity", "")
  },
});
});
```

From that code it is feasible for the coder to successfully delay the impact with the help of jQuery. The reprogramming of the codes can eliminate the possibility of a bug in the future implications.

The opacity of the image can be successfully improvised by simple application of the mouse over it. The CSS addition of fadeIn / fadeOut can be rewritten with the application to make things convenient for the coder on each step.
