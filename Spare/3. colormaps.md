## Introduction 
In the world of animation, there are certain measures that seem like a complication which are in reality not a challenging task at all. One such case that usually generates problem for the animators is the process to toggle class for CSS transition in React JS. In this guide, you will learn how to toggle class for CSS transition in React JS. Our main objective is to find precise and trustworthy solution which is easy to learn and implement.

## An Overview
Let us take a case where you are required to toggle a specific CSS class subsequent to an element (or rather the whole page) which is fully rendered. Here, all the relevant properties are to be animated on the page load. Now, we are going to toggle class in the absence of jQuery. If you toggle an element’s class in `componentDidMount`, it is the animation that won’t actually happen.

Before proceeding further and in order to make the whole process seamless, there are certain questions that you need to answer in advance. For instance, at which phase do you precisely would like to animate the component? It is basically necessary to decide the same in advance as during the coding you are required to specify the exact class name in the `render()` function, this will make the component to be rendered with animation on page load.

## The Correct Approach 
If you would like to avail toggle/control animation subsequently after the first render, and to have control over the class name using the component state, you should follow the given code:


```javascript
var Hello = React.createClass({
    getInitialState: function(){
        return {
            condition:false
        }
    },

    handleClick :function(){
        this.setState( { condition : !this.state.condition } );
    },

    render: function() {
        return <div >
                <div className = { this.state.condition ? "animated" :"" }  > Hello {this.props.name} </ div>
                <button type = "button" onClick = {this.handleClick} > Change Condition </ button>

               </ div>;
    }
});

React.render(< Hello name = "World" />, document.body);
```

So, if you look at the codes highlighted above then you will find that the changes have been bought in the state in response against the button click. Now, while you go with the application it is totally up to you whether you might want to change it to some sort of other event or not. 

To immediately load an animation after the page is loaded, you can go with the above code, but just change the `this.state.condition` in the `componentDidMount` method. As a programmer, what you need to take into account is the compatibility with the browser. Do make sure to run some compatibility tests in advance to verify that everything is running fine at each step of the transition. It is recommended due to the fact that if there is a compatibility issue with the browser then there are chances that the CSS class is implemented straightaway without transition actually taking place. 

As an alternative way, in the CSS class, you can also apply toggle class in the following manner:


```javascript
var node = ReactDOM.findDOMNode(this.refs.el);
node.classList.toggle('menu-open');
```

## Conclusion
Now, the method that we used to toggle class for CSS transition in React JS is assured to render the positive results. It is basically because we have set the state ideally and run the tests to ensure the compatibility. In React JS, we have set the function in the initial state (as you can see above) so that we can state the class name and change the condition with a single button click.
