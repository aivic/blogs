## Introduction
There have been a number of budding animation developers who have frequently ask how effective React-reveal actually is? What is the depth of animation that can be achieved with the help of this animation framework? And above all, will this framework be actually conducive enough when the things will shift to advanced animation? So, here, in this guide, we would try to throw some light on a specific type of animation framework which is specially designed to work for React component.

## About React Reveal
React Reveal framework designed by the professionals of React JS community to incorporate the widest possible library of basic, intermediate and advanced animations. The best thing about the components of this library is that right from fade, zoom, flip, and rotate to the transitions of additional time duration like scroll can be availed through this framework. 

When you are animating a ReactJS component on Render with React Reveal then the programming framework will enable you to have the control of all types of animations along with props. For instance, the position, distance, delay, cascade, etc. can be controlled in an effective manner. If as a developer, you prefer custom CSS effects then it can also be achieved via this framework. Apart from that, the framework also features the server end rendering along with high order components. 

As mentioned above, React Reveal will enable you to construct scroll animation in a dependable way. Let us have a glance upon how it actually functions:


```javascript
import Fade from 'react-reveal/Fade';
<Fade top >
	<h1 > Title </ h1>
</ Fade>
```

If you are implementing them in the form of animation for the generation of the scroll effects then it would look like the following:

In this form of animation, the entire functioning of the animation will take place on the left hand side of the dialogue box. Controlling the scroll bar to generate blocks on the screen is one of the key functions over here.

Keep moving down the scroll to ensure the appearance of a new block onto the screen simultaneously.

The user can keep bringing down the scroll on the right end of the screen and can add as many blocks as required. The size of the scroll will diminish as the number of blocks will increase. The position of the scroll can be observed on the right end side with the mouse cursor which will automatically indicate the flow of block slides to appear one after another.

It is important to note that irrespective of the number of the blocks that have been created, each can have a full screen page within the framework and the title and sub title can be included as per the convenience.


```javascript
import React, { Component, Fragment } from 'react';
import Fade from 'react-reveal/Fade';

const animateList = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

export default class ReactReveal extends Component {
	render ( ) {
		return (
			<Fragment >
				{animateList.map((item, key) => (
					<div style = { styles.block } key = { key } >
						<Fade top >
							<h1 style = { styles.title } > {`block ${item}`} </ h1>
						</ Fade>
					</ div>
				))}
			</ Fragment>
		);
	}
}

const styles = {
	block: {
		display: 'flex',
		alignItems: 'center',
		justifyContent: 'center',
		width: '100%',
		height: '100%',
		background: '#000',
		borderBottom: '1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2)',
	},
	title: {
		textAlign: 'center',
		fontSize: 100,
		color: '#fff',
		fontFamily: 'Lato, sans-serif',
		fontWeight: 100,
	},
};
```
