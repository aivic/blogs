## Introduction
When we talk about the basic animation right from the gif memes to the slider pages of a dynamic commercial website, then there have been many components helping out the user in the framework. We had discussed a few of the important ones in previous guides. Now the one that we are going to discuss down here is a sort of React UI library which has an abundance of easy to apply elements adding multiple dimensions to the animation you would like to materialize. So, let’s commence the guide on how to animate a React JS component on Render with the help of Ant Design.

The application of Ant Design is widely regarded as one of the acclaimed components for the creation of seamless user interfaces. The creation credit of this component goes to the Asian conglomerate giant Alibaba and the users are some of the renowned names in the world including Tencent, Ant Financial, Koubei, Meituan, Didi, Eleme and Baidu. 

## A Brief on Ant Design 
The objective of this design language is to uniformly maintain the user interface especially for the internal background projects. It also helps in curtailing the excessive design differences cost and implementation. It liberates the design resources as well as resources meant for front-end development. 

Since the inception of this design language till date, Ant Design has enhanced the experience of both product designers and the end users. Here, it is worth notable that the user experience designers as well as the user interface designers are collectively termed as product designers. It is harsh but true that in the contemporary world of animators the work and job role is so cross-linked that the thin line of difference between product managers, develop engineers, interaction designers, visual designers and front-end developers has been blurred. Now, this design language is ensuring that the prototype and the design remain unpretentious and accessible for the project members of every class and section. Ant Design does this with the help of unitary specifications and comprehensively upholds the development proficiency and experience of the background products and applications. 

## An Illustration
In order to understand the basic work of Ant Design, we are going to demonstrate its role in a sample animation on a type of landing page.

There are a multiple animated elements in this diagram. There are different geometrical shapes working in tangent and shapes. Here, the animation is in a framework of one to two seconds where all the transition objects wobble from their actual position to and fro in order to create the basic structure of animation. One of the key challenges for the basic animators down here is that the transition would take place between multiple components simultaneously. 

As one can find a multiple number of elements in the transition taking place above, it can generate a slight confusion among the users who are starting right from the basic level. In order to ensure a better understanding, let’s have a glance at a shorter version.

Now, here we have constrained the whole animation to short version to have a better understanding to the user. It is easier to understand because there are fewer elements which are identical to one another in terms of animation. We have picked the globe with the green colour ball along with one element. Here, the one specific element that we have chosen is a red square existing in the background.

In order to realize this sort of animation, the application of `TweenOne` component is used. It is noteworthy that in order to use the path in animation, there is a requirement of the `PathPlugin`. It will usually work when the user push the `Pathplugin` to `TweenOne.plugins`.


```javascript
TweenOne.plugins.push(PathPlugin);
```

## Basic Animation Parameters
In this next step of this guide, we throw some light on some of the basic animation parameters:


1. The Time Duration: The time of the animation will be in `ms`.
2. The ease of animation: The ease of doing the animation scaling from easy to tough.
3. YoYo compatibility: Moving to and fro with each form of repetition. 
4. Repeat Animation: In order to conduct a repeating animation process, the user is required to apply -1 in order to procure an indefinite process. 
5. P: The parameter denotes the coordinates of path for the animation. 
6. easePath: Enable a seamless path coordinates for the animation to work. 

In general terms, you need not worry about the penultimate and ultimate parameters in the list; as those parameters are more specific to Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). 


```javascript
const duration = 7000;
const ease = 'easeInOutSine';
const p = 'M123.5,89.5 C148,82.5 239.5,48.5 230,17.5 C220.5,-13.5 127,6 99.5,13.5 C72,21 -9.5,56.5 1.5,84.5 C12.5,112.5 99,96.5 123.5,89.5 Z';
const easePath = 'M0,100 C7.33,89 14.33,81.66 21,78 C25.36,75.60 29.87,72.90 33,70 C37.04,66.24 39.39,62.07 42.5,57 C48,46.5 61.5,32.5 70,28 C77.5,23.5 81.5,20 86.5,16 C89.83,13.33 94.33,8 100,0';

const loop = {
	yoyo: true,
	repeat: -1,
	duration,
	ease,
};
```

## The Front-End Implementation
The React JS component is used to compress a library of elements which can be expressed in Ant Design language. The adaptability is one of the key aspects because of which this design language is an ideal choice for front end implementation. There are many design systems accessible for the front-end frameworks that the developers from the designer community can pick from. Some of the common choices (apart from Ant Design of React JS) that are widely used in the current community include NG-ZORRO - Ant Design of Angular / Ant Design of Vue / NG-ZORRO-MOBILE - Ant Design Mobile of Angular / vue-beauty (vue) /  antue (vue) / antd-ember and antizer (ClojureScript). 

Now, coming back to the object animation guide, let’s commence with the creation of an animation object which comprises of given types of animation:


1. redSquare:  the animation comprises of loop params, which we explain below, and the Y coordinate, the time specific duration, and delay.
2. greenBall:  it comprises of the path with object params `x`, and `y` as value `p`. the time duration, the ease and repeat. 
3. path: it enables the easePath coordinate.
4. lengthPixel:  it works in the segregation curve along into 400 sections.
5. track: it is an oval shaped with the axis that comprises of the loop styles as well as the rotate param.

One can understand the application of these animations in the following code lines:


```javascript
const animate = {
	redSquare: {
			loop,
		y: 15,
		duration: 3000,
		delay: 200,
	},
	greenBall: {
		path: { x: p, y: p },
		duration: 5000,
		repeat: -1,
		ease: TweenOne.easing.path(easePath, { lengthPixel: 400}),
	},
	track: {
			loop,
		rotate: 15,
	},
};
```

You don't have to be concerned about this code much as you are required to focus upon the `TweenOne` component. 


```javascript
<TweenOne component = "g" animation = { animate.redSquare } />
<TweenOne component = "g" animation = { animate.track } />
<TweenOne component = "g" animation = { animate.greenBall } />
```

It is critical to keep in mind that these components will be introduced from `rc-tween-one`. It is applied as rudimentary components with both the base props as well as animation props. Now, the finished product of the animation is ready. Each `TweenOne` has its own sort of animation rules such as redSquare, greenBall, track, etc. 

As one can see the creation of animation with this design language is not a tough nut to crack. All as a user you are required to do is elaborate the animation rules and then transfer those rules to `TweenOnecomponent`.


## Conclusion 
Ant Design language is recommended due to its versatility and the widespread utility it can render to the designers and developers at each level. It is seamless and is proficient enough to eliminate the complications when a number of animation components work simultaneously. It is one of the few frameworks that dominated every continent across the globe due to its seamless proficiency and stable results without compromising with the storage size and results in quick rendering. 

So, one can certainly animate a React JS component on render using Ant Design and anticipate strong results.
