## Introduction
The creation of the React component is one of the essential learnings that the developers are required to go through right from the beginning. The developers know the fact that the library for the React animations is created with `animate.css`. It ensures an easier application and comprises of a plethora of animation segments to choose from.  

It doesn’t matter which sort of inline style library we are talking about, until the point it supports the object application like keyframe animations like Aphrodite, Radium, etc. the React animation can be put in use. Here, in this guide our preference will be to get an insight on how to use the style components in React animations and how to animate the React JS component on Render. After the completion of this guide, it would be easier for you to understand how the basic react animation is built and how as a developer one can improvise to avail better animation result every time. 

## Basic React Animation Example 
We encounter this sort of animation component on daily basis on gif memes existing over the social media. One of the common react animation examples can be represented by the following image taken from a known gif meme, which displays an awe expression.

![A typical gif image used to display an awe expression](https://i.imgur.com/0ww6kum.png)

The animation duration usually lasts 1 to 2 seconds and captures the moment of a particular character or object within that time frame. 

For instance, in this particular image the camera is zooming in to capture the essence of the expressions denoting the vibe the meme is related to. 

Now, it is not hard to realize at which place this kind of animation usually comes handy. But how it actually works is something that is worth mentioning. 

In order to see how it actually functions, let’s take an example of a Bounce animation. 


```javascript
import React from "react";
import styled, { keyframes } from "styled-components";
import BounceIn from "@bit/formidablelabs.react-animations.bounce-in";
const BounceInAnimation = keyframes`${BounceIn}`;
const BounceInDiv = styled.div`
  animation: infinite 5s ${BounceInAnimation};
`;
export default (
  <BounceInDiv >
    <img src="https://picsum.photos/300/200/?random" />
  </ BounceInDiv>
);
```

Here, the image follows three repeatitive steps:


1. The image appears from the centre of the screen from opaque to clear resolution.
2. The image crosses the borders of the screen and fully pops out from inward to outward. 
3. The image bounces back and leaves proportionate margins on each side of the frame. 

Now, let us learn to create a bouncing text step by step. First and foremost, you need to pick the selected animation from react-animations. 

Next, apply the styled component after the creation of the wrapped component with the rudimentary keyframes and transition style. 


```javascript
const Bounce = styled.div`animation: 2s ${keyframes`${bounce}`} infinite`;
```

Do note that once the component is formed, the user is required to wrap up any kind of add-on component or HTML for animation. 

The programming code as well as a directive example is mentioned below for your reference:


```javascript
<Bounce ><h1 > This Animation Bounces </ h1></ Bounce>
```

The complete code is shown below:


```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';
import './style.css';

const Bounce = styled.div`animation: 2s ${keyframes`${bounce}`} infinite`;

export default class ReactAnimations extends Component {
	render () {
		return (
			<Bounce ><h1 > This Animation Bounces </ h1></ Bounce>
			);
	}
}
```

Once implemented, the animation can work seamlessly. Do note that it is meant for the basic type of animation only and is quite simple to execute. If you are planning to try it on a more advanced level then it is professionally recommended to apply this animation on scroll. It can simply be done via React-animate-on-scroll.

## The Application of the React Animations with Radium

You can import all kinds of animation straight from the chief package. 


```javascript
import { fadeIn } from 'react-animations'
```

or you can also import a particular animation too as shown:


```javascript
import fadeIn from 'react-animations/lib/fade-in'
```

If you are applying the React animations with the help of Radium then the following set of codes could help you right away. The bounce animation which is rendered on this platform is stable, reliable and seamless.


```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';
import Radium, {StyleRoot} from 'radium';

const styles = {
  bounce: {
    animation: 'x 1s',
    animationName: Radium.keyframes(bounce, 'bounce')
  }
}

class Test extends React.Component {
  render() {
    <StyleRoot >
      <div className = "test" style = { styles.bounce } >
      </ div>
    </ StyleRoot>
  }
}
```

## The Application of the React animations with Aphrodite 
The following codes can be implemented by the developer in order to fetch good results. The bounce animation acquired here will surely be stable as the duration will only be of a second. 


```javascript
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';
import { StyleSheet, css } from 'aphrodite';

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  bounce: {
    animationName: bounce,
    animationDuration: '1s'
  }
})
```

## The Application of React Animation with the help of Network Service Security of Java (JSS)

In order to fetch the best results on Java Interface, it is advisable to go with the following codes. 


```javascript
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';
import jss from 'jss'
import preset from 'jss-preset-default'

jss.setup(preset())

const {classes} = jss.createStyleSheet({
  '@keyframes bounce': bounce,
  bounce: {
    animationName: 'bounce',
    animationDuration: '1s',
  },
}).attach()
```

## The Application of React Animations with Styled Components 
In order to attain better results in the bounce animation with the help of styled components, the developer can emphasize on the following code liners:


```javascript
import styled, { keyframes } from 'styled-components';
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';

const bounceAnimation = keyframes`${bounce}`;

const BouncyDiv = styled.div`
  animation: 1s ${bounceAnimation};
`;
```

## The Application of React Animations with fela-JavaScript
The effective coder lines for an animation of 2 seconds, the following commands will aid you in a superlative manner. The key application of this component primarily emphasize upon the background of the bouncing animation including the height and the width. 

Import and render the following:


```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { createRenderer } from 'fela';
import { createComponent, Provider } from 'react-fela';
import { bounce } from 'react-animations';

const mapStylesToProps = ({ background, height, width }, renderer) => ({
	animationName: renderer.renderKeyframe(() => bounce, {}),
	animationDuration: '2s',
	background,
	height,
	width,
});

const BouncingDiv = createComponent(mapStylesToProps, 'div');

render(
	<Provider renderer = {createRenderer()} >
		<BouncingDiv background = "red" height = "100px" width = "100px" />
	</ Provider>,
	document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

## The Categories of Animations
All kinds of animations that can be worked upon and rendered in React are mentioned below:

```
bouceOut / bounce / bounceIn / bounceInDown / bounceInLeft / bounceInRight /
bounceInUp / bounceOutDown / bounceOutLeft / bounceOutRight / bounceOutUp /
fadeIn / fadeInDown / fadeInDownBig / fadeInLeft / fadeInLeftBig / fadeInRight /
fadeInRightBig / fadeInUp / fadeInUpBig / fadeout / fadeOutDown /
fadeOutDownBig /  fadeOutLeft / fadeOutLeftBig / fadeOutRight / fadeOutRightBig /
fadeOutUp / fadeOutUpBig / flash / flip / flipInX / flipInY / flipOutX / flipOutY /
headshake / hinge / jello / lightSpeedIn / lightSpeedOut / pulse / rollIn / rollout /
rotateIn / rotateInDownLeft / rotateInDownRight / rotateInUpLeft / rotateInUpRight /
rotateOut / rotateOutDownLeft / rotateOutDownRight / rotateOutUpLeft /
rotateOutUpRight / rubberBand / shake / slideInDown / slideInLeft / slideInRight /
slideInUp / slideOutDown / slideOutLeft / slideOutRight / slideOutUp / swing
/ tada / wobble / zoomIn / zoomInDown / zoomInLeft / zoomInRight / zoomInUp /
zoomOut / zoomOutDown / zoomOutLeft / zoomOutRight / zoomOutUp
```

## The Application of React Animations with Merge
During the application of react-animations the developer can export a merge function which will enable a pair of animations and revert back with a new animation combining the features of both. If there are components that are contradicting each other then it will not work well with Merge. 
For example, if you are implementing fadeIn and fadeOut animation then it can create complications. The merged animation could be executed like any other form of imported transitions.


```javascript
import { merge, tada, flip } from 'react-animations';
const tadaFlip = merge(tada, flip);
```

## Conclusion
The animation of a React JS component on Render with React animations will always broaden the skills of the developer in terms of basic transition displaying awe inspiring style. One of the key strengths of this platform is the number of animation categories that the developer can access. There are also no bugs reported in the past or present pointing fingers on security concerns. 

So yes, it is recommended to animate the React JS component with React animations as it offers a win-win situation to both developer and the final user in terms of implementation and usage.
