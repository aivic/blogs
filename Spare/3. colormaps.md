## Introduction
The process of mobile rendering for jQuery and React is one of the fields where some good amount of research has been done for quite some time. It is basically due to this research and continuous trial and error that we have attained certain frameworks which enable us to acquire precise results in this direction. 

This guide is basically an effort to make you familiar with certain aspects. One of the key is to integrate React component with the already present jQuery mobile application. We will basically divide this guide into two parts and bifurcate methods of mobile rendering to ensure that you get familiar with different approaches. 

# The Baseline
It is important to note that the React is a form of JavaScript UI framework which permits the user to create component based type user interface controls which deals with mobile applications. It is important to note that one of the significant advantages of applying this framework is that every component will maintain its own kind of state. These components will remain independent of one another making it easier to create individual UI pieces. It will make it independent from rest of the mobile application and it is feasible to be reused in different other areas related with the app. 

There are several present mobile applications created previously with the help of jQuery, there might be a requirement of creating new React component or mobile application which can easily integrate as well as communicate with jQuery mobile application. For instance, the user would like to go through details from jQuery based mobile application rendering on the page. If the user wishes to display data within React component, the React component will require finding a way requesting data from jQuery application, thereafter storing it in identical state. 

There are three models for communicating React to jQuery and vice versa. One way is the direct reference of jQuery object, secondly, with the help of an intermediate manager and lastly via a simple subscriber/ publisher.

## From the JQuery to the React Component
In case of a basic HTML document, the code looks as follows:


```html
<div class = 'container' >
  <h1 > JQuery to React using $(this) </ h1>
  <div id = 'box' style = 'border: 1px solid #333; background-color: red; width: 100px; height: 100px;' ></ div>
  <hr />
      
  <div id = 'root' class = 'mt-3' ></ div>
</ div>
```

In the present, jQuery mobile app are merely comprises of header message as well as a square in coloured form. As per the approach of this guide, we are also going to incorporate a div in order to serve the base of the React component formed by us to render within. As mentioned above, there are three methods to interact with jQuery from the React and it is the time to discuss these methods in an elaborative manner. Here, in this guide, we will emphasize on first two models.

## Method 1: The Direct Reference of jQuery Object
It involves the passing of the React component as a copy of JQuery $(this) for the constructor, while initially forming React component. By this approach, it would be possible for React to manipulate the present mobile application UI elements. One can observe the design that we acquire in the image down below:

**The integration of the React component with jQuery via reference**

In the diagram above, jQuery app will create React component in the starting with the help of call to `React.createElement`. After the completion of this step, they will be passing it in context of jQuery application to components constructor. Now, the component can store reference in the current state and will be able to change the mobile page elements existing outside own component area.


```
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(MyComponent, { context: $('body') }), document.getElementById('root'));
});
```

In the above mentioned sample code, it displays the component formed in the initial stage. The constructor of the component passed a reference to JQuery conducive body object accessible in the props of constructor of components. 

### The React Component
The code for React component in order to store the jQuery context are as follows:


```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {
      context: props.context
    };
    this.onClick = this.onClick.bind(this);
  }
  
  onClick() {
    // Get reference to a JQuery object in parent app.
    var box = this.state.context.find('#box');
    
    // Change the color of the box.
    box.css('background-color', (box.css('background-color') === 'rgb(255, 0, 0)' ? 'green' : 'red'));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div className = 'alert alert-success' role = 'alert' >
        <h3 > Hello, from React! </ h3>
        <button type = 'button' className = 'btn btn-default' onClick = { this.onClick }> Click Me </ button>
      </ div>
    );
  }
}
```

Here, the component which is defined above provides simple button and message. While clicking the button, the component will get an access to jQuery context in order to bring change to the background colour or the UI element located outside its normal landscape. 

A standard image of the application is represented below:

## Method 2: Application of Intermediate JS Class
This method involves the passage of React component as a reference to JS class object, serving as intermediary in the communication between existing mobile app and new React component. Now, it would be feasible for the component to request data as well as the values existing in intermediate class or rather update specific areas related to the page in the form of new data. 

Flow chart displayed below showcases the type of layout on the grounds of which the React component can actually get in touch with the existing jQuery mobile app via intermediate class.

Here, it is important to observe how JQuery controls its segment of mobile page elements. Similarly, React component controls own segment of mobile page elements. One of the major advantages of the approach is that the separation of concerns between React components accountability for the UI elements on the mobile page as well as JQueryâ€™s application responsibility for own UI elements. 

The code result for the intermediary class is as follows:


```
ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(MyComponent, { context: UIManager }), document.getElementById('root'));
```

The UIManager Class in this type of method can be represented as shown:


```javascript
var UIManager = {
  getColor: function(parent, callback) {
    callback($('#box').css('background-color'), parent);
  },
  setColor: function(name) {
    $('#box').css('background-color', name);
  }
};
```

## Conclusion
After the completion of two methods in this guide, we will start will the third method of mobile rendering for jQuery and React in the second edition of this guide.
