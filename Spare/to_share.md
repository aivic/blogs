## Introduction
The animation of list-reordering comes at an intermediate to advanced level of transition. Basically, it is due to the fact that when it comes to the list reordering then there are multiple levels and complexities that are attached to it. The level of layers and components added to the list decides what level of animation is executed to get things done. In this guide, you'll learn how to animate a list-reordering using various libraries.

## Setting a Problem Statement
When it is about animating a list ordering in React JS there is a significant number of animators who demand a React JS friendly approach to animate the list reordering. 

To set a scenario for list-reordering, consider a list of items comprising of scores, ordered by scores, and vertically organized list in React JS. The list comprises of rectangular components with highest scores at the top. Hovers as well as the other clicks pointing on individual items may hide or show additional info altering the height vertically.

With the arrival of the new information, the changes take place in the scores, gradually making few of the items rank at higher order as well as others at the lower after the re-sort. Now, all the concerned items are animated simultaneously to their respective new position, instead of appearing at new location straightaway. 

## The Suggestive Way to Accomplish This Using React JS
To attain seamless yet dependable list-reordering the inclusion of add-on components can play a pivotal role.

Before starting with React JS, if we try to solve the same case in the `D3` library, then it would follow the given steps:
- Publish the list along with item Document Object Model nodes in respective natural order, comprising of relative positioning. It is basically through the relative positioning as well as the other minute changes that the JS or CSS is actually triggered. 
- Transform all the Document Object Model (DOM) nodes within single step in order to avail real relative coordinates as the new sort absolute coordinates. Here, a Document Object Model changes that result in no kind of visual change. 
- Next, re-arrange item Document Object Model nodes, inside the parent, to arrange a new sort order, another Document Object Model change resulting in none of the visual change. 
- Animate the top offsets of all the nodes to their respective newly measured values on the grounds of the heights of preceding items aligned in new ordering. The step is merely a visually receptive one.
- Last but not the least; alter all DOM nodes items back to the non-offset sort of relative positioning. Here, no kind of visual change does take place but the now-relatively-positioned DOM nodes, in the natural ordering of the underlying list, will handle internal hover/expand/etc style changes with proper shifting.

To solve this problem in React, Joshua Comeau presented a module named [react-flip-move](https://github.com/joshwcomeau/react-flip-move), which does few things differently than Magic Move/Shuffle as listed:
- It brings the FLIP procedure for hardware-accelerated 60FPS+ animations.
- It provides options to "humanize" the shuffle by incrementally offsetting delay or duration.
- It can also handle interruptions gracefully, resulting in no weird glitch effects.
- Plus, bunch of other neat stuff like start/finish callbacks.

An alternative to the given library is [react-flip-toolkit](https://github.com/aholachek/react-flip-toolkit) whose comparison with two other libraries is provided in the given table:

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Animate positio | Y | Y | Y |
| Animate scale | N | Y | Y |
| Animate opacity | N | Y | Y |
| Animate parent's size without warping children | N | N | Y |
| Use real FLIP instead of cloning & crossfading | Y | N | Y |
| Use springs for animations | N | N | Y |
| Support spring-based stagger effects | N | N | Y |
| Usable with frameworks other than React | N | N | Y |

## The React-animate-reordering Library 
The basic crux of the entire relisting is that when the elements in the react components are reordered then it does result their children be animated to respective new positions. 

At the present moment, only the vertical movement is controlled as well as including or eliminating the elements of the list not included in the animation. All the handling is done by the module `react-shuffle`, so it is an option to go for it. Nevertheless, it presently mounts children twice as well as doesnâ€™t improvise the state properly on the children. 

It is utterly based on what you would like to accomplish. Are you interested in the list reordering itself or rather present yourself with a react-draggable list? 

### The Utility 
Here, it is essential that your application comprises of the following CSS rule. 


```css
.reorder-wrapper-item {
  position: relative;
  transition: top 1s ease-in;
}
```

After using this code, you are required to wrap up some of the elements associated with `AnimateReorder` component. It is advisable that while creating the application you do ensure that each element possesses a distinctive key set!

The code shown below indicates the coding done via `AnimateReorder`. All the arranged class components related to the list are displayed while precisely arranging the commands. 


```javascript
var AnimateReorder = require('react-animate-reorder');

class SomeComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    var list = [ /* ... */ ];
    return (
      <div >
        <AnimateReorder >
          {list}
        </ AnimateReorder>
      </ div>
    );
  }
}
```

## Conclusion
In this guide, you have learned about the use of `react-animate-reordering` library in animating list-reordering. You have also learned about the `react-flip-toolkit` library as an alternative to this problem and its comparison with two other libraries.
